Higanbana

Higanbana's formal dress. She hasn't worn it lately because it tends to cause her shoulders to stiffen up. This dress is much more similar looking to the one she wears as a doll than the one she normally wears.

Despite being the subject of a frightening ghost story, and being particularly notorious among the students, she's actually quite slobbish.
Lying around on the infirmary bed and watching late night anime is part of her nightly routine.

Quite different from the unnerving image of a doll dancing the night away that the children know her for.

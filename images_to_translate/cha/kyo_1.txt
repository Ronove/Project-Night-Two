Kyou

The 5th Ranked School Youkai. Kyou of the Mirror.
He is the guardian of the mirrors that lead to other worlds.
He also controls the different personalities that humans show.

He has a nihilistic and wild personality, and is particularly vicious to humans.
Apparently this is because of a grudge against humans froms when he was still an animal spirit.

Even if he tries falsify how he's feeling with a poker face, his emotions still come out through his tail. This a source of much dismay to him.

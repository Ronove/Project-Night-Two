Tomoko Okada

An occult loving girl on par with Michiru. Her areas of expertise are ancient civilizations and superscience. Aliens are okay too.
She likes to chat while drawing, and her art is pretty good.

She slipped and fell to a quick death. But even in death she's still itching for someone to talk to.

Incidentally, she has a really good fashion sense. If she were to lose the glasses, she would be an exceedingly beautiful girl.

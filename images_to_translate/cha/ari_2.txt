Shuuichi Arimori

The blind master pianist.
He utilized his great sensitivity, and transferred his representation of the world from his sketchbook to the piano.

As a graduate of the school, today he has been invited to give a speech to the children.
It's a mammoth of a school, so it's not that far-fetched for a few prominent figures to have graduated from it over the years.

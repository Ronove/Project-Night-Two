Masaaki Yoshikawa

A boy of smallish stature from the same class as Yukari Sakaki.
He caught the eye of several bigger and meaner bullies and spent his days being bullies by them.

Being a person that hates losing, he adamantly refused to accept that he was being bullied.
Because of that he ended up changing himself by way of a magical thistle.

He hates Yukari for interfering.
He's the kind of guy who ends up acting mean to the girl he likes.

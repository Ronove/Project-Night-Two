Yuuki Noda

Because of his soft personality, he's the type that the upperclassmen girls like to dote on.
But he wishes that he was treated in a more manly way.

Unfortunately, the moment he finally worked up the courage to refuse someone, he met the end of his life. Truly a sad story.
Incidentally, his sense in art is very unique. If he had been born in a different era, he may have become a famous artist.

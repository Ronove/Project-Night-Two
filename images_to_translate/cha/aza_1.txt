Azami

The 4th Ranked School Youkai. Azami the Vengeful.
There are magical thistles, only visible to those who are being bullied. If they eat one of those thistles they will become a bully themselves.
She is the youkai who commands those magical thistle. She is also the elder sister of Sumire.

She uses her honeyed words to draw in prey. It's a terrifying hypocritical technique.
Her ladylike manner of dressing draws in bullied children and makes them think she's some goddess who has come to save them.
Apparently there was once a time when she would take on a human guise and became an incredibly bad bully herself.

Shuuichi Arimori

A former student of the school. He is a very sensitive boy.
Being as gentle as he is, the chaos within the school made him an easy target for bullying.

He has a strange power that allows him to see the world differently based on his emotions, and he has made it his mission in life to draw pictures of the scenery he sees.
The reason that he is able to converse with youkai is because he has a similar wavelength to them.

Even now, he is one of the very few humans that Higanbana respects.

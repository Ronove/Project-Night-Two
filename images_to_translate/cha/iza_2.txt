Izanami-sensei

The hot-blooded gym teacher that advises the track and field club.
The temporary appearance that Izanami takes when he needs a human form.

"If you've got time to worry, then run!" he spouts off his motto while driving the students to keep running with his bamboo sword.
Most of the students are frightened by him, but there are a good amount of girls that are enthusiastic fans of his.

He's had so much fun training the students that he's been forgetting to hunt.

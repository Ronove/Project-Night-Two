Aya Souma

A girl who has lost the will to live, and remains living out of sheer force of habit.
When she stepped on the 13th step, she was forced into a 49 day trial, searching for the meaning in life.

Having survived the trial, she underwent a major change, and even became a member of the track and field club.
Her club advisor looks a lot like Izanami. He's still working her hard, even today.

Every day she counts the steps on each staircase she walks on in the hopes of meeting Izanami again.

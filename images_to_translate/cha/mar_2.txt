Marie Moriya

When challenged to learned how to freely change her clothes with her own power, this was what she came up with.
It is a mix of the uniform from the school she wanted to attend, and her innermost feelings of wanting to do whatever she wants.

She finds it embarrassing and rarely puts it on, but when she does beware, it means that she's gone into serious mode.
In accordance with the rules of the story of Mesomeso-san, she pulverizes her enemies with superhuman strength.

She has made it her mission in death to seek out poor children targeted by youkai and help them.

The Vice Principal

The temporary appearance that the Black Tea Gentleman takes when he needs a human form.
He's actually employed as the vice principal, and supports both the human and the youkai Headmaster.

He's usually downright coldhearted when it comes to teachers doing their job, so whenever he's at work the staff room falls as silent as death.
The only time he'll show an honest smile is when he's talking about his favorite hobby, tea.

Dealing with problems before they ever reach the Headmaster's ears is his greatest virtue.

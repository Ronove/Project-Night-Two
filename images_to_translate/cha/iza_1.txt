Izanami

The 2nd Ranked School Youkai. The Reaper of the 13th Step.
He curses whoever steps on the 13th step to be chased for 49 days straight.
If you're caught, it's over. You'll be locked away in an unearthly cage of a world, left to melt for all eternity.

He loves to preach his beliefs about enthusiasm as his prey runs from him.
He decorates his living quarters with quotes from Shuzo Matsuoka.

He's been on bad terms with the vice principal (Black Tea Gentleman) ever since he was scolded for running in the halls.

Renoir

The 6th Ranked School Youkai. Renoir of the Art Room.
He is a tsukumogami, a youkai born from a very old inanimate object, that haunts painting in the art room.
He's usually fast asleep, but every once in a while he will wake up and pull a human into one of the paintings.

This being an era when no one has any room in their heart for showing interest in paintings, he finds himself sleeping a lot.

He very rarely interferes with the other school youkai's hunts, so they tend to dote on him like a younger brother.
